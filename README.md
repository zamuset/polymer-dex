# Project Title

Pokedex like app with Polymer 2

## Getting Started

Pokedex like app using bower as packages manages, implementing own customElements as well as paper and iron elements from webComponents.
Implements databinding, customEvents and local database.

### Prerequisites

Basic knwoledge of Polymer 2, WebComponents and how to install them

### Installing

Just clone the repo or download the zip file to your computer and run "bower install" on a terminal

## Deployment

After all dependencies are installed you'll have to run "npm run fake:api" in one terminal and then "npm run spa" in other terminal so you can access the local endpoints and therefore make consults and save information

## Detail by element

* [poke-app.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-app.html)
Custom element that contains the logic for the route in the application so the app can jump to "poke-dex-page.html", "poke-form-page.html" and "poke-region-page.html"

* [poke-button.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-button.html)
Custom elements that contains a simple button with a background image given by the pokemon received in "poke-list.html" component.

* [poke-card.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-card.html)
This element combines the "poke-button.html" and the "poke-label.html" components to make a card like component that displays the image and the name of a given pokemon.

* [poke-container.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-container.html)
Simple container element that holds a slot without any specified class so it can display any given content inside itself.

* [poke-dex-page.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-dex-page.html)
Simple container page for the poke-dex.html element

* [poke-form-page.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-form-page.html)
Simple container page for the poke-form.html element

* [poke-form.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-form.html)
Custm element that contains an iron-form element to receive data input from the user to save new Pokemons to the database, the id texfield is calculated automatically when the user inputs the pokemon name, in the name textfield an autocomplete box pops up as the user starts typing, and the url is autogenerated as the image source for the pokemon, but it can be changed by the user.

* [poke-label.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-label.html)
Custom element that contains the pokemon name

* [poke-list.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-list.html)
Custom element that implements dom-repeat to show as many pokemons as the given array contains and display them in the "poke-card.html" component.

* [poke-region-page.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-region-page.html)
Simple container page for the poke-region.html element

* [poke-region.html](https://github.com/zamuset/polymer-dex/blob/master/src/components/poke-region.html)

Custom element with an input textfield and a checbox to let the user filter the pokemons retreived by name, the element triggers a customEvent, the event is then captured in the "poke-dex-html" and sent to "poke-region.html" element tha finally passes the filter to the "poke-list.html" element which holds the logic to filter the pokemons list and retreive only the ones that matches the applied filter.
